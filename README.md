# 💰 VAT Calculator

This Java program calculates the Value Added Tax (VAT) based on a user-entered amount.  
If the amount is between **0 and 1000 TL**, a VAT rate of **18%** is applied.  
For amounts **above 1000 TL**, a VAT rate of **8%** is applied.

The program then displays:
- Amount excluding VAT
- VAT rate
- VAT amount
- Total amount including VAT
